# Hi, I'm Alec Hudson 👋

I'm a student studying Mechanical Engineer. I build innovative solutions to real-world problems. Check out my projects below!

## My Story!
Growing up in Orlando surrounded by Disney, I’ve known since childhood that I wanted to become an Imagineer — designing rides and experiences that bring joy to millions each year. Every skill I’ve learned, every design I’ve created, and every prototype I’ve built has been driven by that dream: blending mechanical engineering with creativity to turn imagination into reality.

As a Mechanical Engineering student, I’m honing technical abilities in prototyping, controls, and innovative problem-solving through hands-on projects that mirror ride systems and themed entertainment. Below are a few I’ve showcased — I hope you’ll dive in and see how they align with my passions!

Thank you for visiting — I’d love to connect and chat about engineering magic. 🚀
