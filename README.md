### 1. IV Bag with position control and low level fluid sensing
   - desinged and fabricated a IV holder which height adjustable between 5 and 7 ft. It also will measure the level of fluid in the IV bag using a load cell and an alarm will go off when it gets below a desired percentage
   - Solidworks, Arduino IDE, Soldering
   - Link to Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjZ4MjLh-VY
   - Achieved top marks in my entire class
   - 📐 Download full 3D model (STEP): [IV Project.STEP](IV%20Project.STEP)
