### 1. IV Bag with position control and low level fluid sensing
   - desinged and fabricated a IV holder which raises and lowers between 5 and 7 ft. It also will measure the level of fluid in the IV bag using a load cell and an alarm will go off when it gets below a desired percentage
   - Solidworks, Arduino IDE, Soldering
   - Link to Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gjZ4MjLh-VY
   - Achieved top marks in my entire class
   - 📐 Download the full 3D model: [[IV Project.step](IV Project.step)](https://github.com/Alec-Hudson24/Alec-Hudson24/blob/8172feae08f5deccbfc4d61be5180c613d4efd7b/IV%20Project.STEP)

### 2. Systems Dynamics and Controls Autonomous Indycar Controller
   - Desinged a controller to autonomously get a Indycar around a track
   - Matlab and Matlab plugins
   - Enhanced Stability by a factor of 10
